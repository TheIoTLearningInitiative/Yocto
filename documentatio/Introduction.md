# Introduction


The base content for this Gitbook comes from "Introduction to the Yocto Project: A hands-on approach" by Leo Sandoval and Team @ Intel Internal Presentation.

> It's not an embedded Linux distribution â€“ it creates a custom one for you. The Yocto Project is an open source collaboration project that provides templates, tools and methods to help you create custom Linux-based systems for embedded products regardless of the hardware architecture.
